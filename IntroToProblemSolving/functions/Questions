    Single line integer output.

Q5 -> Problem Description

    Given two integers A and B, where A is divisible by B.

    Print the value of quotient, when A is divided by B.

    Note: It is not necessary that A is completely divisible by B

    Problem Constraints

    -109 <= A, B <= 109

    Input Format

    First argument is a single integer A.
    Second argument is a single integer B.

    Output Format

    Print a single integer in a single line.

Q6 -> Problem Description:

    Given the temperature of a day in Degrees Celsius, convert this given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Complete the function to do so. Round the output up to 2 decimal places

    Note:

    To round up the values -
    Python : Use round(ans,2) to round up ans to two decimals
    Java : Use Math.round(val*100)/100d to round upto two decimals
    The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: F = (9/5 * C) + 32
    You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.

Q7 ->  Problem Description
    Given three integers, A, B and C. You have to find the number of days it will take to reach zero cases of Corona in a city.
    
    A - Average cases recovered in a day of the corona.
    B - Number of new cases of corona daily.
    C - Current active cases of the corona.
    
    Return the minimum number of days it will take to reach 0 active cases of Covid.
    
    Problem Constraints
    
    1 <= B < A <= 5000
    1 <= C <= 1000
    
    
    Input Format
    
    The first argument will be integer A, which denotes the recovered cases in a day.
    The second argument will be integer B, which denotes the new cases in a day.
    The third argument will be integer C, which denotes the currently active cases.
    
    
    Output Format
    
    Return an integer which denotes the minimum days to reach 0 cases.
