Q2 -> Problem Description

    Given two numbers A & B. Return their product.


    Problem Constraints

    1 <= A <= 104

    1 <= B <= 104

    Input Format

    First argument is an integer A.

    Second argument is an integer B.

Q4 -> Problem Description

    You are given an integer A.

    You have to find the value of cube of A i.e, A3.


    Problem Constraints

    1 <= A <= 1000

    Input Format

    First and only parameter is an integer A.

    Output Format

    Single line integer output.

Q5 -> Problem Description

    Given two integers A and B, where A is divisible by B.

    Print the value of quotient, when A is divided by B.

    Note: It is not necessary that A is completely divisible by B

    Problem Constraints

    -109 <= A, B <= 109

    Input Format

    First argument is a single integer A.
    Second argument is a single integer B.

    Output Format

    Print a single integer in a single line.

Q6 -> Problem Description:

    Given the temperature of a day in Degrees Celsius, convert this given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Complete the function to do so. Round the output up to 2 decimal places

    Note:

    To round up the values -
    Python : Use round(ans,2) to round up ans to two decimals
    Java : Use Math.round(val*100)/100d to round upto two decimals
    The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: F = (9/5 * C) + 32
    You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.
